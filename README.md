In this project we set out to address three principal questions about grade distributions at UW-Madison:
1) do students generally perform better in classes in one foreign language than others?
2) does the room in which a class is taught have any relationship with grades awarded to that class?
3) does time at which a class is taught have any bearing on grades awarded to that class?

The database we used to answer these questions can be found here:
